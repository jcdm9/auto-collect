# installation

We have two paths, a front and back end. Each do these steps to install dependencies.

front end:
```
cd fpup
npm install
```

back end:
```
cd pup
npm install
```

# running the application

Front and Back end should be run for this whole process to work.

front end:
```
cd fpup
npm start
```

You should see something like this if everything were properly installed:
```

```

back end:
```
cd pup
npm run dev
```
